# esp-mqtt-neomatrix-text

I use [esp-remotecontrolled-led-matrix](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/esp-remotecontrolled-led-matrix) or [esp-http-neomatrix-text](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/esp-http-neomatrix-text) depending on the needs.
The MQTT version isnt in use by me anymore (which doesnt mean it shouldnt work anymore).
